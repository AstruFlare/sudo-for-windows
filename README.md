[Latest release](https://github.com/sharedwonder/sudo-for-windows/releases/latest)

## 1.Introducing

As we all know, in Linux (and some Unix-like systems) we can use `sudo` and `su` to elevate privileges (run as root).

But in Windows, we need to elevate privileges through UAC (User Account Control). This makes us have to open a new terminal with administrator privileges when we want to run commands as administrator.

So I made this software. It can help us run commands as administrator without having to open a new terminal.

## 2.Install

First, download the compressed package of this software ([download the latest version](https://github.com/sharedwonder/sudo-for-windows/releases/latest)) and extract to a secure directory.

- ***SET FILE SYSTEM PERMISSIONS TO PREVENT STANDARD USERS FROM MODIFYING THESE FILES. OTHERWISE, STANDARD USERS WILL BE ABLE TO RUN ELEVATED PROCESSES!***

Use this command to create the service for this software:

```powershell
sc create SudoService type= own start= auto binPath= "<path-to-service-exe>" DisplayName= "Sudo for Windows Service"
```

- Replace `<path-to-service-exe>` with the path to "SudoService.exe".

Then, start the service:

```powershell
sc start SudoService
```

- The service will start automatically the next time.

At last, add the directory where the software is stored to the `PATH` environment variable.

Now, you can use `sudo` and `su` commands in Windows!

## 3.Uninstall

Use this command to stop the service:

```powershell
sc stop SudoService
```

Then, remove the service:

```powershell
sc delete SudoService
```

At last, remove the directory where the software is stored (don't forget to remove the path from the `PATH` environment variable).

## 4.Build

Required environment:

- [Microsoft Visual Studio 2022](https://aka.ms/vs) or later *with Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools v143 or later*
- Microsoft Windows SDK 10.0 or later

Commands:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/sharedwonder/sudo-for-windows.git
cd sudo-for-windows
msbuild "Sudo for Windows.sln" -p:Configuration=Release -p:Platform=<arch>
```

- Replace `<arch>` with the architecture (x64, x86, ARM, ARM64) that you want to build.

Then you can see the target files in the directory `targets\<arch>`.

There should be the following target files:

- su.exe
- sudo.exe
- SudoConfiguration.dll
- SudoHelper.exe
- SudoRpcClient.dll
- SudoService.exe
